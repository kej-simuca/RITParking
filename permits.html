            <p>All students must register their vehicle and purchase a parking permit annually at the start of the
                academic year through MyParking Portal. Permits may not be shared - each student must have their own
                permit. Students who will not be at RIT for the entire year can register for a single semester permit at
                50% the annual cost.The types of permits available to you are determined by your current local address,
                as specified in SIS.
                Please make sure your current local address is updated, and the effective date is set for the first day
                of permit sales before attempting to purchase a parking permit.
                The RIT parking office regularly enforces parking on campus. All drivers are expected to park in
                accordance with RIT parking policies and procedures. All citations issued to vehicles parked on campus
                in violation of RIT parking policies will be the responsibility of the person who registered the
                vehicle. For additional information please see Parking Rules and Regulations

                <p>Students who live in University Commons must purchase the parking permit associated with their

                    residents

                    be
                    notified through RIT Events of parking options for the requested date and event. In the event of any
